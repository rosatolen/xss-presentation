## Prepare for the workshop

Install all application dependencies.

The following commands should run without errors:
* `git clone https://github.com/rosatolen/xss-presentation.git`
* `cd xss-presentation`
* `./gradlew xss-demo-app:test`
* `./gradlew xss-demo-app:run`
* Navigate to `localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Run tests

* `./gradlew xss-demo-app:test`
* `./gradlew xss-demo-app:intTest`
* `./gradlew xss-demo-app:uaTest`
* `./gradlew xss-demo-app:appSecTest # which should fail at first`

## Run the app

* `./gradlew xss-demo-app:run`
* Browse to `http://localhost:8080`
* Admin username/password is `admin/password`

## Fix it!
* The `appSecTest` are there to guide you though fixing the vulnerabilities
* But remember, a passing test does not imply correctness!

## Review slides (or become a facilitator!)
* Open presentation/xss.html in a web browser!
